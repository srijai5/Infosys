## 🧩 Key Features

### 🔹 1. Automated Reminder Notifications
- Sends **email notifications** to users based on their **course completion percentage**.  
- Notifications are sent **three times a day** (morning, afternoon, evening) for incomplete courses.  
- Personalized reminders encourage learners to resume and complete their courses.  

### 🔹 2. Smart Quiz Attempt Alerts
- Automatically detects **new or pending quizzes** in enrolled courses.  
- Sends **reminders and dashboard alerts** prompting learners to attempt tests.  
- Ensures assessments are not missed, improving overall progress and accuracy of learning metrics.

### 🔹 3. AI-Driven Course Completion Insights
- Uses **AI models** to analyze progress data and predict which courses are **most likely to be completed soon** (≥75%).  
- Highlights these courses with **pop-up alerts** on the user dashboard.  
- Personalized prompts motivate users to finish courses and achieve certifications faster.
